\title{Calculate Size-Dependent Mortality Probability}
\usage{
calc_mortality_probability(trees, mort_params = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{Data.table with columns: DBH (cm), Species}

\item{mort_params}{List. Species-specific mortality parameters with structure:
list(SPECIES = list(base = ..., size_effect = ..., dbh_coef = ...))
Default parameters favor mortality of small trees:
- PIED: base=0.05, size_effect=0.45, dbh_coef=0.08
- JUMO: base=0.04, size_effect=0.40, dbh_coef=0.07  
- JUSO: base=0.04, size_effect=0.40, dbh_coef=0.07}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. Mortality probability for each tree (0-1)
}
\description{
Calculates mortality probability for each tree based on size (DBH) using
negative exponential relationships. Smaller trees have higher mortality.
}
\details{
Mortality probability calculated as:
P(mortality) = base + size_effect * exp(-dbh_coef * DBH)

This creates decreasing mortality with increasing DBH:
- Small trees (DBH < 10cm): High probability (0.3-0.5)
- Medium trees (DBH 10-30cm): Moderate probability (0.1-0.3)
- Large trees (DBH > 30cm): Low probability (0.05-0.15)

Probabilities are constrained to [0, 1].

\examples{
trees <- data.frame(DBH = c(5, 15, 25, 35),
                    Species = c("PIED", "PIED", "JUSO", "JUSO"))
