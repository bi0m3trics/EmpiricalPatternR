\title{Calculate Nurse Tree Association Energy}
\usage{
calc_nurse_tree_energy(trees, nurse_distance = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{Data.table with columns: x, y, Species}

\item{nurse_distance}{Numeric. Target mean distance from PIED to nearest 
juniper (m). Default 3.0m based on field observations.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Energy value representing squared deviation from target
  distance. Lower values indicate better match to target association pattern.
}
\description{
Calculates deviation from target nurse tree associations. In pinyon-juniper
ecosystems, pinyon pines (PIED) often establish near junipers (JUMO/JUSO)
which act as "nurse trees" providing shade and protection. This function
quantifies how well the current tree pattern matches this association.
}
\details{
For each PIED tree, calculates distance to nearest JUMO or JUSO tree.
Returns squared deviation of mean distance from target. Returns 0 if
either species is absent.
