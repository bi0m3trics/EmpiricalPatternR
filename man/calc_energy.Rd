\title{Calculate energy (deviation from targets)}
\usage{
calc_energy(
  metrics,
  targets,
  weights,
  trees = NULL,
  nurse_distance = 3,
  use_nurse_effect = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metrics}{Current stand metrics}

\item{targets}{Target parameters}

\item{weights}{Weights for each component}

\item{trees}{Current trees (for nurse tree calc)}

\item{nurse_distance}{Target nurse tree distance}

\item{use_nurse_effect}{Whether to include nurse tree energy}
}
\value{
Total energy (lower is better)

All metrics are normalized to relative errors so weights range 0-100:
  0   = ignore this metric
  1-20  = low priority
  20-50 = moderate priority  
  50-80 = high priority
  80-100 = critical (will dominate optimization)
