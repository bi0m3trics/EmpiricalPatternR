\title{Add Tree with Nurse Tree Effect}
\usage{
perturb_add_with_nurse(
  trees,
  plot_size,
  species_names,
  species_probs,
  dbh_mean,
  dbh_sd,
  nurse_distance = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{Data.table. Current tree data}

\item{plot_size}{Numeric. Plot dimension in meters}

\item{species_names}{Character vector. Available species codes}

\item{species_probs}{Numeric vector. Target species proportions (must sum to 1)}

\item{dbh_mean}{Numeric. Mean DBH for new tree (cm)}

\item{dbh_sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of DBH (cm)}

\item{nurse_distance}{Numeric. Target distance to place PIED near juniper (m).
Actual distance is drawn from normal distribution with mean = nurse_distance
and SD = 0.3 * nurse_distance.}
}
\value{
Data.table. Updated tree data with new tree added
}
\description{
Adds a new tree to the stand. If adding a pinyon pine (PIED), places it
near an existing juniper to reflect nurse tree facilitation. Other species
are placed randomly.
}
\details{
New tree species is selected based on species_probs. If PIED is selected
and junipers exist, tree is placed at distance ~ N(nurse_distance, 0.3*nurse_distance)
from a randomly selected juniper. Position is constrained within plot bounds.
DBH is drawn from N(dbh_mean, dbh_sd) and constrained to minimum 5cm.
