## Usage

``` r
calc_canopy_cover(x, y, crown_radius, plot_size = 100)
```

## Arguments

  - x:
    
    Vector of x coordinates (m)

  - y:
    
    Vector of y coordinates (m)

  - crown\_radius:
    
    Vector of crown radii (m)

  - plot\_size:
    
    Size of plot (assumes square, m)

## Value

Proportion of plot covered by canopy (0-1)
